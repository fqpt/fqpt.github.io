## What Makes Bitcoin Cash Unique?

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created in August 2017 through a hard fork from Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain. This split addressed Bitcoin‚Äôs scalability limitations by increasing block sizes from 1 MB to 32 MB, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. While Bitcoin evolved into a store of value, BCH focuses on fulfilling the original vision of cryptocurrency as peer-to-peer electronic cash.  

### Technical Advantages  
- **Block Size**: 32 MB vs. Bitcoin‚Äôs 1 MB  
- **Transaction Speed**: ~10 minutes per block  
- **Average Fee**: $0.001‚Äì$0.01 per transaction  

## How Does Bitcoin Cash Work?

BCH operates on a decentralized blockchain using proof-of-work (PoW) consensus. When users initiate transactions:  
1. Network nodes validate transactions against the blockchain‚Äôs history.  
2. Valid transactions are grouped into blocks using Merkle trees.  
3. Miners perform cryptographic hash computations to secure blocks.  
4. Blocks are chained together, making tampering nearly impossible.  

This structure ensures transaction immutability while maintaining pseudonymous privacy. Users interact with BCH through wallet addresses derived from cryptographic key pairs.
