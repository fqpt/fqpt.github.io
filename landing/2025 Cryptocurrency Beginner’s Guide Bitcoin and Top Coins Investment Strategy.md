### Q2: What differentiates Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies?
Bitcoin's unique features include its status as the original cryptocurrency, fixed supply cap, widespread institutional adoption, and established market infrastructure compared to newer, often more experimental altcoins.

### Q3: Are crypto ETFs a good investment option?
Crypto ETFs provide regulated exposure without direct wallet management requirements. They're particularly suitable for conservative investors seeking market participation with reduced technical complexities.

### Q4: How to choose a reliable crypto exchange?
Key selection criteria include regulatory compliance (SFC license), security features (cold storage, 2FA), trading volume (liquidity), supported currencies, and user interface intuitiveness.

### Q5: What tax implications exist for Hong Kong crypto investors?
Hong Kong currently maintains a favorable tax environment with no capital gains tax on virtual assets. However, investors should consult tax professionals regarding specific circumstances and potential future regulatory changes.

## Future Outlook and Strategic Recommendations

As Hong Kong continues developing its crypto regulatory framework, investors should focus on:
- **Compliance First**: Prioritize SFC-licensed platforms
- **Education Investment**: Continuously update technical knowledge
- **Portfolio Balance**: Maintain crypto allocation within risk tolerance
