## Strategic Applications and Case Studies  

### Case Study: Scaling a Trading Team  
A professional team with a 10 million USDT portfolio managed to attract 20 investors using OKXâ€™s subaccount system. By aggregating trading volume across accounts, they achieved a higher VIP tier, reducing their effective commission rate by 30%. This allowed them to offer competitive pricing to investors while boosting their profit margins.  

### Example: Risk-Mitigated Investing  
An institutional investor delegated $2 million to a trading team while retaining withdrawal controls. The team executed a diversified arbitrage strategy, generating a 15% return over six months. The investor could monitor fund balances but remained protected from exposure to sensitive trading logic.
