### Factors Influencing USD to HKD Exchange Rates  

1. **Interest Rate Policies**: The US Federal Reserveâ€™s rate decisions often drive USD strength. For example, if the Fed raises rates while the HKMA holds steady, the USD may appreciate against the HKD.  
2. **Global Economic Conditions**: During market volatility, the USD acts as a "safe-haven" currency, increasing demand.  
3. **Pegged Currency Mechanism**: Hong Kongâ€™s linked exchange rate system ensures the HKD remains tethered to the USD, limiting long-term volatility.  
4. **Trade Balances**: Chinaâ€™s economic performance indirectly impacts HKD demand due to Hong Kongâ€™s role as a financial hub.
