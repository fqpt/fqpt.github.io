### Case Study: Automating a RSI-Based Strategy  
A trader identifies a profitable RSI divergence pattern on Ethereum's price chart. Using Pine Scriptâ„¢, they code the strategy and set up a Webhook alert.

By combining TradingView's alerts with OKX's order management tools, a portfolio manager sets dynamic stop-loss levels across multiple positions. During a market downturn, automated adjustments protect capital while preserving upside potential.
