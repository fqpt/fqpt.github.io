## Understanding Cryptocurrency Basics

Before diving into candlestick analysis, letâ€™s clarify what cryptocurrencies are. These digital or virtual assets use cryptography to secure transactions and control unit creation. Unlike traditional currencies, they operate on decentralized networks, primarily blockchain technology. Bitcoin (BTC), launched in 2009, pioneered this space and has since grown into a global investment asset. Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) further expanded the ecosystem, offering diverse use cases beyond simple transactions.

Cryptocurrencies trade 24/7 on decentralized exchanges, making technical analysis crucial for navigating their volatile markets. This is where **candlestick chart patterns** become indispensable tools for identifying trends and entry/exit points.

## How to Read Crypto Candlestick Charts

A candlestick represents four key price points: open, close, high, and low within a specific timeframe. The "body" shows the opening and closing prices, while "wicks" (or shadows) indicate the highest and lowest prices reached. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

- **Bullish Candle**: Close price > Open price (often green/white)
- **Bearish Candle**: Close price < Open price (often red/black)
- **Long Upper Wick**: Rejection of higher prices
- **Long Lower Wick**: Rejection of lower prices

## Step-by-Step Guide to Analyzing Patterns

### Step 1: Select Your Cryptocurrency
Focus on major pairs like BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, or emerging altcoins. High-liquidity assets provide more reliable patterns.
