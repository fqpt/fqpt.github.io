# Policy Trends and Outlook for Virtual Asset ETFs (Part 2)

This article explores the evolving regulatory frameworks for virtual asset exchange-traded funds (ETFs) across the United States, Hong Kong, and Canada. As BTC and ETH ETFs gain mainstream traction, understanding jurisdictional compliance requirements becomes critical for investors and financial institutions navigating this emerging asset class.

## Virtual Asset ETF Regulatory Frameworks

### United States: Rigorous Compliance Standards
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains stringent oversight of virtual asset ETFs, applying existing securities laws rather than creating specialized crypto regulations. Key requirements include:

1. **Regulatory Framework**: 
   - Governed by the Securities Act of 1933 and Investment Company Act of 1940
   - Mandatory SEC registration under Rule 6c-11 for ETF operations
   - Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols

2. **Approved Assets**: 
   - Limited to BTC and ETH due to their market maturity and established infrastructure
   - Combined $1.2 trillion market cap and 24/7 trading volume exceeding $50 billion daily

3. **Trading Mechanics**: 
   - Cash-based subscription/redemption model preferred
   - Standard trading hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST
   - Management fees ranging from 0.19% (ARKB) to 1.5% (GBTC)

4. **Security Measures**: 
   - 80% of assets stored in cold wallets
   - Dual custody model (e.g., Coinbase + BNY Mellon)
   - Multi-signature technology for transaction authorization
