## BCH Enters Mainstream Retail Channels

In a significant move toward mass adoption, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has officially become accessible at **21,000 retail locations** across Canada, Europe, and Australia. This expansion, announced by cryptocurrency over-the-counter (OTC) brokerage and virtual ATM network provider Netcoins, marks a pivotal moment for BCH's integration into everyday financial systems.

The partnership enables users to purchase and transact BCH through Netcoins' virtual ATM platform, eliminating the need for physical hardware.

"Our network now supports six of the top seven cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, combining both our OTC trading capabilities and extensive retail partnerships."

This milestone reflects Netcoins' ongoing commitment to cryptocurrency adoption since launching its virtual ATM service in 2015. The Vancouver-based company continues to innovate by removing traditional barriers to entry in the crypto space.

## BCH Adoption Momentum Builds

This expansion follows a series of strategic developments in the BCH ecosystem:

1. **BitPay Integration**: On August 29, blockchain payment leader BitPay announced BCH settlement support, allowing merchants to split proceeds between fiat currency and BCH.

### Transaction Volume Debate

Bitcoin Cash advocate Roger Ver sparked industry discussions by claiming BCH accounted for **64.7% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume** over 24 hours.
