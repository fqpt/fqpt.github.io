# XRP Price Breaks $2.30: Legal Clarity and Banking License Fuel Bullish Outlook  

The digital asset XRP has surged past $2.30, driven by regulatory progress, strategic banking initiatives, and robust technical momentum. This article explores the catalysts behind XRPâ€™s recent rally, analyzes market dynamics, and evaluates long-term valuation models.  

## Rippleâ€™s Strategic Shift Toward Institutional Dominance  

Rippleâ€™s pursuit of a U.S. national banking license and Federal Reserve master account marks a transformative pivot. Previously embroiled in legal battles with the SEC, the company now focuses on building infrastructure for institutional adoption. CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized this shift, stating Rippleâ€™s priorities now center on ecosystem development rather than litigation.  

The firmâ€™s RLUSD stablecoin, backed by $469 million in reserves, positions XRP as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain. Securing a master account would allow Ripple to settle USD reserves directlyâ€”a rare privilege held by elite financial institutions. This move could redefine XRPâ€™s role in global payments and attract institutional capital.

- **RLUSD Stability**: The stablecoinâ€™s $469M backing enhances trust in Rippleâ€™s financial infrastructure.  
- **Fed Master Account**: Direct access to USD reserves would streamline cross-border transactions.
