## Building ‚ÄòSolana on Bitcoin‚Äô  

Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs vision hinges on replicating Solana‚Äôs success in democratizing token creation while anchoring it to Bitcoin‚Äôs robust infrastructure. By integrating a Solana-inspired architecture, the platform achieves transaction speeds of up to 10,000 TPS (transactions per second) at sub-cent fees‚Äîa stark contrast to Bitcoin‚Äôs traditional 7 TPS at higher costs.  

### Why Bitcoin Dominance Matters  
Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance recently surged to a four-year high, signaling renewed institutional and retail interest. Bitcoin Pepe capitalizes on this momentum by introducing meme-based assets to attract younger, tech-savvy investors who previously found Bitcoin too ‚Äúserious‚Äù for engagement.  

#### Key Metrics of the ICO  
| Stage | Price (USD) | Duration |  
|-------|-------------|----------|  
| 1     | $0.021      | 24 hours |  
| 15    | $0.05       | 48 hours |  
| 30    | $0.0864     | 72 hours |  

Half of the 2.1 billion token supply will be allocated to the ICO, with the remainder reserved for staking rewards, marketing, and development.
