# How to Mint NFTs With Utility Gas-Free on Polygon

The rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has transformed digital ownership, but high gas fees and technical complexity often deter creators.

## Understanding Polygon and Gas-Free Minting

Polygon (formerly Matic) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering faster transactions and lower fees. Its NFT Minter simplifies the creation process by integrating **gas-free transactions** powered by Biconomy‚Äôs infrastructure. This eliminates the need for users to pay ETH-based fees, making NFT creation accessible to everyone.

### Key Features of Polygon‚Äôs NFT Minter
- **ERC-721 vs. ERC-1155 Standards**: Choose between unique collectibles (ERC-721) or semi-fungible tokens (ERC-1155), which support batch transfers and multi-token contracts.
- **Soulbound NFTs**: Create non-transferable tokens tied permanently to a wallet, ideal for identity verification or loyalty programs.
- **Custom Utilities**: Add unlockable content, physical item redemption, or social media authentication.
